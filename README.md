# Jeopardy Trivia

This is a fully self-hosted Jeopardy Trivia website with over 100,000 questions to choose from! It uses NodeJS as the backend and vanilla JS as the frontend, though I plan on moving this over to React once I get some more time.

## Description

This was a great way of using Node/Express to GET and POST data from a large JSON file

## Getting Started
Fork and clone the repository, then run npm install and node server.js. I recommend using nodemon to keep the server running and track changes, if you wish to make any to the app.
